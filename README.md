# Retrofit-Library

In this tutorial we are having the Retrofit Android Library Tutorial which is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square. By using Retrofit in Android we can seamlessly capture JSON responses from a web API. It is different from other libraries because Retrofit gives us an easy way to use since it uses the GSON library in background to parse the responses. All we need to do is define a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) to do all the parsing. In this Retrofit Android Library Tutorial, we will discuss the basic scenarios where it can be used.
